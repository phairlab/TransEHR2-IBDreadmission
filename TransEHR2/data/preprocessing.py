"""Stage C extraction: ``data/root`` to ``data/extracted`` (sections 4, 5).

Readings this module commits to
-------------------------------

* **``lookup`` replaces the text internals.** ``_bucket_valued_feats``
  returns numeric / categorical / ordinal / lookup, and text and drugs
  share one CSR writer parameterised by slot count (section 4.3, escalated
  in section 9 and decided 2026 August 23, C1). On disk the names stay
  ``text_*`` and ``drug_*`` per section 4.4; only the internals are one
  path. A single-slot feature writes no dose or mask array, its weight
  being 1 by definition, and its values array is rank 1 -- both are what
  section 4.4's table asks for.
* **The extractor assigns the ``text_values`` row indices** (escalated
  2026 August 23, C1, since section 9 makes neither C1 nor C4 depend on
  the other). Workers hand back the raw string; the insertion pass interns
  it, first appearance in canonical row order winning index 0, and writes
  the table's key order to ``text_strings.pkl``. C4's ``embed_text.py``
  embeds that list *in that order*, which is what makes the index valid.
* **The drug pad index comes from ``ClinVec_atc.csv``, not from
  ``drug_embeddings.npy``.** Section 4.4 pads unused slots with ``V``, the
  final all-zero row of a ``(V+1, 128)`` table C4 builds. Deriving ``V``
  from the cohort's own indices would be wrong -- a vocabulary entry no
  patient was dispensed would leave the pad colliding with a real drug --
  so it is read from the vocabulary file Stage A indexed against
  (``prepare_RMT23345_PIN.R:75-77``). This adds ``CLINVEC_PATH`` to the
  dataset config, which section 5's cleanup list does not mention.
* **Every row of ``labels.csv`` is extracted; none is filtered out.**
  Section 3's fold arrays are row indices into these arrays, so the row
  count is fixed by ``labels.csv`` and a dropped episode would silently
  shift every later fold index. ``MIN_EPISODE_LEN_STEPS`` therefore
  becomes a *reported count* rather than a filter -- invariant 4 makes
  every ``INDEX_TIME`` name a ``timeseries.csv`` row, so an episode below
  the minimum means an upstream invariant failed, which is worth saying
  out loud rather than quietly deleting.
* **The series is right-aligned** (section 4.2): the index time, the last
  record and ``t = 0`` all land in the final column, and the left of the
  row is zero padding. The section's "no left-padding" refers to the
  history region the old layout reserved, which is gone; "right-aligned at
  the prediction origin and zero-padded on the left" is the alignment.
* **Misses are counted once per record, not once per episode.** A record
  inside ten episodes' windows is one out-of-domain value in the data, not
  ten, so the per-feature report (section 4.3) counts over each patient's
  timeseries once.
* **``index_times`` is looked up in ``stays.csv``, in ``labels.csv``
  order.** Section 3 makes ``labels.csv`` the canonical order but gives it
  no ``INDEX_TIME`` column, so the value is joined on
  ``(PATID, STAY_INDEX)`` while the order stays the file's.
* **Extraction loads no tokenizer.** Under section 4.4's content
  addressing the tokenizer only matters when ``text_tokens.npy`` is built,
  which is C4's. ``metadata.pkl`` records ``LLM_NAME``,
  ``TOKENIZER_PAD_TOKEN`` and ``MAX_TOKEN_LENGTH`` from ``constants.py``;
  the *resolved* ``pad_token_id`` section 4.4 also asks for is added by C4,
  where the tokenizer is actually loaded and the fact established.
* **Invariant 12 runs before any patient data is read.** Section 6 asks
  for it as the first step of ``extract_data.py``. The category_map clause
  used to be checked inside the per-timestep loop, so a bad map raised
  part-way through a multi-hour run (section A.3); it is hoisted here.
  IBDdataprep's ``check_contract.py`` is the CI-side copy of the same
  three clauses -- importing it would put a cross-repository dependency in
  the extractor's import path.

    """Prepare training, (validation), and test DataLoaders for MixedDataset.

    This function creates PyTorch DataLoader instances for `MixedDataset` objects prepared by
    `extract_data()`. The dataset uses memory-mapped numpy arrays for efficient multi-worker
    access with minimal memory overhead. Workers share read-only memory-mapped arrays rather
    than duplicating data in each worker process' memory space.

    NOTE: like ``load_dataset``, this still assumes the pre-C1 layout of
    one directory per fold partition. C2 brings it on to the cohort-wide
    arrays and the fold row indices of section 3.

    Args:
        data_dir (str): Directory containing 'train/', 'val/', and 'test/' subdirectories. Each
            subdirectory should be the output of `extract_data()`.
        batch_size (int): Number of samples per batch (per GPU in distributed settings).
        num_workers (int, optional): Number of worker processes for data loading. Defaults to 4.
        pin_memory (bool, optional): Whether to pin memory in DataLoader for faster GPU transfers.
            Defaults to True. Only effective if num_workers > 0.
        prefetch_factor (int, optional): Number of batches to prefetch per worker. Defaults to 2.
            Higher values increase memory usage but can improve throughput if batch processing by
            the model is slower than data loading. Only effective if num_workers > 0.
        balance_text (bool, optional): If True and running distributed (world_size > 1), use
            TextBalancedDistributedSampler to balance text density across ranks for all partitions.
            Defaults to False.
        world_size (int, optional): Number of distributed processes. Required if balance_text=True.
        rank (int, optional): Current process rank. Required if balance_text=True.

    Returns:
        List[DataLoader]: List of DataLoaders in order: [train_loader, val_loader (if available),
            test_loader]. If validation data are not found, only [train_loader, test_loader] is
            returned.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If 'train/' or 'test/' directories are not found in `data_dir`.
        ValueError: If balance_text=True but world_size or rank is not provided.
