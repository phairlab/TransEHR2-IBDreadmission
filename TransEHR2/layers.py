            `EncoderLayer` via `non_padding_mask` instead.

    Note:
        The query axis is left at size 1 to broadcast rather than expanded to `seq_len`. Every
        query row of a bidirectional encoder masks the same keys, so the square form carries no

        200 and 550 timesteps -- once the attention inverts it. The event encoder's mask is
        genuinely two-dimensional because it also carries the causal triangle, and is built

            `EncoderLayer` multiplies padding rows by zero on the way out, so both paths deliver zero there.

    r"""A custom implementation of TransformerEncoderLayer that uses BatchNorm instead of LayerNorm
    
    This transformer encoder layer block is made up of self-attn and feedforward network.
    It differs from TransformerEncoderLayer in torch/nn/modules/transformer.py in that it replaces LayerNorm
    with BatchNorm.

    The layer is batch-first unconditionally: it builds its `MultiheadAttention` with
    `batch_first=True` and expects `(batch_size, seq_len, d_model)` input. Unlike
    `torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer` it takes no `batch_first` argument, so callers that
    build either layer from a shared set of keyword arguments must not pass one.

    Note:
        `src_key_padding_mask` gates attention but not normalization: padded timesteps still
        contribute to the BatchNorm statistics. This matches the upstream mvts_transformer
        layer this derives from, and biases the running statistics toward whatever padding
        embeds to as the padded fraction of a batch grows.

        `Tensor` mask that prevents attention at the indicated positions. The shape should be
        [target sequence length, source sequence length] or 
        [batch size * heads, target sequence length, source sequence length] if a different mask is to be used for each
        batch. The `key_padding_mask` parameter takes `src_key_padding_mask` as its argument, which is a `Tensor`
        indicating which elements of `key` should be ignored by the attention heads. One would pad an input sequence if
        it is shorter than a predefined length, and the padding mask would indicate which elements are padding.
